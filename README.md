# Inspiration
As a college student, moving in and moving out is always a very painful process. I have to purchase a lot of things such as table, chairs, kitchen supplies, and many other things. They cost a lot of money and at the end of every year, I will have to sell or get rid of them to move out. Most of those items are still usable or just like new. It is really wasteful to throw them away. For that reason, I built a shopping app to help me and everyone who has the same problem, and I called the app, Exchange. It provides flexibility in shopping which allow users to buy or sell their items in many different ways, not just about money.

# What it does
As a seller in Exchange, you can post your item and get discovered within minutes. You can post up to four pictures of your item(s), describe your item(s), set your wishlist, and simply click "Post Item". In addition, you can easily manage your store using the app. What is unique about this app is that since you only specify a wishlist of things you want in exchange, you will receive many different offers. Not just the thing you are looking for, but also a larger number of items you might love from other people.

As a buyer, you can browse thousand of different items on the market. You won't have to worry about money anymore since you can always send a request that you can afford. You can use your items in exchange for the things you love on the market and simple send the request to be reviewed by the seller
